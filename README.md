# oreily-java-multithreading

This repo is created to go through the multi threading concepts.

The first part is executing tasks in parallel with forkjoin pool.


The author provided the demo of his grandpa collecting apples from 6 trees. If he takes 1 hour to collect apples from each tree
then it will take 1 * ^ = 6 hours to collect apples from all the trees.

But when his grandpa accompanied 2 of his friends to collect apples, the time taken for each person will be 2 hours and all
the trees are covered with in 2 hours. This is the logic behind multithreading.
